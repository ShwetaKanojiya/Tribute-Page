                        <p class="text">Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, better known as the "Missile Man of India," was a
                            source of inspiration for millions around the globe. His life, work, and words continue to
                            motivate and guide individuals, especially the youth, towards a path of success and
                            fulfilment.
                            This post aims to share some of his most powerful and inspirational quotes that
                            can serve as guiding lights in our lives. Born in a humble family, Kalam's journey from
                            Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavan is a testament to his indomitable spirit, unwavering
                            determination, and immense dedication. His life story is a beacon of hope for many, proving
                            that with hard work and perseverance, one can achieve their dreams, no matter how lofty they
                            seem.
                            Working towards success can be a painstakingly long process, often leading us to give up out
                            of despair before reaching our goal. Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was a man who taught us to dream,
                            but what did he have to say about the path to success? That is where we start our series of
                            quotes from the legend.</p>
